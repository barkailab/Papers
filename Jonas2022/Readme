This archives contains the Matlab codes used to analyse the data and generate the figures presented in our 
Genome Research Paper "Rtt109 promotes nucleosome replacement ahead of the replicating fork" (DOI:10.1101/gr.276674.122).
The two mains scripts to generate the figures are "FiguresRevision.m" and "FiguresNucs.m", the other files contain helper functions called inside the scripts.
While the scripts and the sequencing data provided at GSE193044 should be sufficient to retrace all analysis, we recommend to download the preprocessed data from Mendeley Data 
(10.17632/svd96gjh6d.1). We hope that the documentation provided in the scripts is sufficent for understanding but are happy to answer any questions via the GitHub page: 
https://github.com/barkailab/Jonas2022/.
Finally, we want to thank you for your interest in our research and wish you great pleasure exploring our data.
Felix
